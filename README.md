# unit13-challenge

## RoboAdvisor

### Overview

The Lex setup was pretty straightforward, but I had trouble getting images/icons to work for response cards. 
The cards would only work without the images, and the workaround required me to remake that slot. The Lambda 
portion, I made a dictionary for risk level inputs for reusability with other key/value pairs.

I initially thought we were grabbing the current AGG and SPY prices from alpaca, which would be a good place 
to further add onto this project.
